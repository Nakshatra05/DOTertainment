## **Introduction**  
**DOTertainment** is a revolutionary **Telegram Mini App** built within the **Polkadot ecosystem** that transforms how creators of humorous content are rewarded. In today’s social media landscape, creators are often undervalued, receiving only "likes" and "reputation" while platforms monopolize direct monetary value. DOTertainment changes this by leveraging **Polkadot's parachains** to reward creators with tangible crypto payouts, empowering them to benefit directly from their creativity and effort.
